Write two uses for why you use inheritance in a program?

Answer:
    1.Code reuse: inheritance allows programmers to reuse their existing class without rewrite
                  it every single time whenever they need to use it. This will save a lot of 
                  time and effort, especially when developing more sophiscated program 
    2. Adding new functionality: inheritance allows programmers to expand the functionality of 
                                 existing classes
